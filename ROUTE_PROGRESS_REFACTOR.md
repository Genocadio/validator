# Route Progress Tracking Refactor

## Summary

Refactored the `RouteProgressTracker` class to use a simpler, more straightforward approach for tracking route progress. The new system eliminates complex HERE SDK route/routeProgress listening and replaces it with three simple functions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Updates

#### TripWaypoint Data Class (`TripResponse.kt`)
Added two new fields to track waypoint-specific distance and time:

```kotlin
data class TripWaypoint(
    // ... existing fields ...
    val waypoint_length_meters: Double? = null, // Length from previous waypoint to this waypoint
    val waypoint_time_seconds: Long? = null, // Time from previous waypoint to this waypoint
    // ... existing fields ...
)
```

These fields will store:
- `waypoint_length_meters`: The distance from the previous waypoint (or origin) to this waypoint
- `waypoint_time_seconds`: The time from the previous waypoint (or origin) to this waypoint

**Note**: These fields have default values of `null` to ensure backward compatibility with existing backend APIs that don't include these fields yet.

### 2. RouteProgressTracker Refactor

Completely refactored the `RouteProgressTracker` class to use three main functions instead of complex route/section progress listening:

#### Function 1: Initialize Waypoint Data
```kotlin
fun initializeWaypointData(
    waypointLengths: List<Double>,
    waypointTimes: List<Long>,
    totalRouteLength: Double,
    totalRouteTime: Long
)
```

**Purpose**: Set waypoint-specific length and time data when the route is calculated.

**Parameters**:
- `waypointLengths`: List of distances from previous waypoint to each waypoint
- `waypointTimes`: List of times from previous waypoint to each waypoint
- `totalRouteLength`: Total route length in meters
- `totalRouteTime`: Total route time in seconds

**When to call**: After route calculation, when you have the segment data for each waypoint.

#### Function 2: Update Progress to Next Waypoint
```kotlin
fun updateProgressToNextWaypoint(
    remainingTimeToNextWaypoint: Long,
    remainingDistanceToNextWaypoint: Double
)
```

**Purpose**: Update remaining time and distance to the next waypoint during navigation.

**Parameters**:
- `remainingTimeToNextWaypoint`: Remaining time to next waypoint in seconds
- `remainingDistanceToNextWaypoint`: Remaining distance to next waypoint in meters

**When to call**: Periodically during navigation (e.g., every 5-10 seconds) with current progress data.

#### Function 3: Mark Waypoint as Passed
```kotlin
fun markWaypointAsPassed(waypointId: Int)
```

**Purpose**: Mark a waypoint as reached and move to the next one.

**Parameters**:
- `waypointId`: The ID of the waypoint that was reached

**When to call**: When the vehicle reaches a waypoint (distance < threshold).

### 3. Removed Features

The following complex features were removed:
- ❌ Route object handling (`setCurrentRoute`)
- ❌ RouteProgress listening (`onRouteProgressUpdate`)
- ❌ SectionProgress processing (`onSectionProgressUpdate`)
- ❌ Multi-waypoint section-based updates
- ❌ Automatic waypoint progress calculation from route sections
- ❌ HERE SDK destination reached handler

### 4. Preserved Features

The following features were preserved:
- ✅ MQTT trip start events
- ✅ MQTT progress updates
- ✅ MQTT waypoint approaching notifications
- ✅ MQTT waypoint reached notifications
- ✅ MQTT destination reached notifications
- ✅ Trip data loading and management
- ✅ Waypoint threshold detection
- ✅ Trip reset functionality

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Three clear functions instead of complex route/section progress handling
2. **Flexibility**: Caller has full control over when and how to update progress
3. **Decoupling**: No longer depends on HERE SDK route/section progress structures
4. **Clarity**: Each function has a single, well-defined purpose
5. **Testability**: Easier to test with simple function calls

## Migration Guide

### Before (Old Approach)
```kotlin
// Set the route
routeProgressTracker.setCurrentRoute(route)

// Listen for route progress updates
routeProgressTracker.onRouteProgressUpdate(routeProgress)

// Listen for section progress updates
routeProgressTracker.onSectionProgressUpdate(sectionProgressList)

// Listen for destination reached
routeProgressTracker.onDestinationReached()
```

### After (New Approach)
```kotlin
// 1. Initialize waypoint data when route is calculated
val waypointLengths = listOf(1000.0, 2000.0, 1500.0) // meters
val waypointTimes = listOf(120L, 240L, 180L) // seconds
routeProgressTracker.initializeWaypointData(
    waypointLengths = waypointLengths,
    waypointTimes = waypointTimes,
    totalRouteLength = 4500.0,
    totalRouteTime = 540L
)

// 2. Update progress during navigation
routeProgressTracker.updateProgressToNextWaypoint(
    remainingTimeToNextWaypoint = 90L,
    remainingDistanceToNextWaypoint = 800.0
)

// 3. Mark waypoint as passed when reached
routeProgressTracker.markWaypointAsPassed(waypointId = 123)
```

## Implementation Notes

- The database operations are currently disabled for testing (marked with "DISABLED" in logs)
- MQTT notifications are still fully functional
- Waypoint approaching notifications still work (5 minutes before arrival)
- Waypoint reached threshold is still 10 meters

## Next Steps

1. Update the route calculation logic to extract waypoint-specific lengths and times
2. Update the navigation handler to call `updateProgressToNextWaypoint` periodically
3. Implement waypoint reached detection logic to call `markWaypointAsPassed`
4. Enable database operations once testing is complete
5. Remove any remaining HERE SDK route/section progress dependencies from other classes

## Files Modified

1. `app/src/main/java/com/gocavgo/validator/dataclass/TripResponse.kt`
   - Added `waypoint_length_meters` and `waypoint_time_seconds` fields to `TripWaypoint`
   - Added default values (`= null`) for backward compatibility with existing APIs

2. `app/src/main/java/com/gocavgo/validator/navigator/RouteProgressTracker.kt`
   - Removed route/section progress listening methods
   - Added three new progress management functions
   - Cleaned up old complex waypoint update logic
   - Preserved MQTT functionality

3. `app/src/main/java/com/gocavgo/validator/service/MqttService.kt`
   - Updated TripWaypoint constructor calls to include new fields
   - Set new fields to `null` since backend doesn't provide them yet

4. `app/src/main/java/com/gocavgo/validator/database/TripEntity.kt`
   - No changes needed (uses TripWaypoint data class)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test waypoint data initialization with different route configurations
2. Test progress updates with varying time/distance values
3. Test waypoint marking with multiple waypoints
4. Test MQTT notifications still work correctly
5. Test final destination reached scenario
6. Test trip reset functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Serialization Issues
If you encounter serialization errors like:
```
Fields [waypoint_length_meters, waypoint_time_seconds] are required for type with serial name 'com.gocavgo.validator.dataclass.TripWaypoint', but they were missing
```

**Solution**: The new fields have default values (`= null`) to ensure backward compatibility. If you still get this error, make sure:
1. The fields have default values in the data class
2. The backend API is returning valid JSON
3. The serialization is using the correct data class version

### MQTT Service Issues
If you encounter compilation errors in MqttService.kt:
```
No value passed for parameter 'waypoint_length_meters'
```

**Solution**: Make sure all TripWaypoint constructor calls include the new fields:
```kotlin
TripWaypoint(
    // ... existing fields ...
    waypoint_length_meters = null, // Not available from backend
    waypoint_time_seconds = null, // Not available from backend
    // ... rest of fields ...
)
```
