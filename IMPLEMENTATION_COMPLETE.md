# Vehicle Location Tracking Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented vehicle location tracking from `navigableLocationListener` in both visual and headless navigation modes. Location data (coordinates, speed, accuracy, bearing) is now stored in a dedicated `VehicleLocationEntity` and also updates the Trip's vehicle info so MQTT messages always include the latest location data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Layer (NEW)

#### Created VehicleLocationEntity.kt
- Stores latest location per vehicle with: vehicleId (PK), latitude, longitude, speed, accuracy, bearing, timestamp
- Only keeps most recent location per vehicle (update-on-insert)

#### Created VehicleLocationDao.kt
- Upsert operation for insert/update
- Query methods: getVehicleLocation(), getAllVehicleLocations()
- Delete methods for cleanup

### 2. Database Configuration

#### Updated AppDatabase.kt
- Added VehicleLocationEntity to entities list
- Added abstract fun vehicleLocationDao(): VehicleLocationDao
- Incremented database version from 7 to 8

### 3. Repository Layer Updates

#### Updated TripRepository.kt
- Modified updateVehicleCurrentLocation() to accept accuracy and bearing parameters
- Stores location in both:
  1. VehicleLocationEntity (with bearing and accuracy)
  2. Trip's vehicle info (for MQTT - lat, lng, speed, timestamp)
- Added vehicleLocationDao member

#### Updated DatabaseManager.kt
- Updated updateVehicleCurrentLocation() signature to accept new parameters
- Passes through to repository

### 4. Navigation Integration

#### Updated NavigationHandler.kt (Visual Navigation)
- Modified navigableLocationListener to extract location data
- Extracts: lat, lng, speed, accuracy, bearing from mapMatchedLocation
- Calls tripSectionValidator.updateLocationData() to cache location
- Database update happens from TripSectionValidator at waypoint progress frequency

#### Updated HeadlessNavigActivity.kt (Headless Navigation)
- Modified setupHeadlessListeners() → navigableLocationListener
- Extracts same data: lat, lng, speed, accuracy, bearing
- Calls tripSectionValidator.updateLocationData() to cache location
- Same update frequency as visual mode

### 5. Trip Section Validator Integration

#### Updated TripSectionValidator.kt
- Added member variables for latest location data
- Added updateLocationData() method to cache location from listener
- Modified writeProgressToDatabase() method:
  - After writing waypoint data, calls databaseManager.updateVehicleCurrentLocation()
  - Ensures location update happens at same frequency as waypoint progress writes
  - Updates both VehicleLocationEntity and Trip's vehicle info

### 6. Fixed TripProgressTracker.kt

#### Updated TripProgressTracker.kt
- Fixed call to updateVehicleCurrentLocation() with new signature
- Passes accuracy and null bearing (Location object doesn't provide bearing)

## Architecture

### Update Frequency
- Location data updates at the same frequency as waypoint progress writes
- Not on every location update from HERE SDK (would be too frequent, ~1-5 seconds)
- Cached and written when writeProgressToDatabase() is called
- Typically during route progress updates (5-10 second intervals)

### Data Flow

```
NavigableLocationListener (every 1-5 sec)
    ↓ extracts: lat, lng, speed, accuracy, bearing
    ↓ caches in TripSectionValidator member variables
    ↓ waits for writeProgressToDatabase() to be called
writeProgressToDatabase() (every 5-10 sec)
    ↓ writes waypoint progress data
    ↓ then updates vehicle location:
    ↓   1. VehicleLocationEntity (with bearing, accuracy)
    ↓   2. Trip's vehicle info (for MQTT)
MQTT Publish
    ↓ reads from database
    ↓ always gets latest vehicle location with trip data
```

### Data Storage

#### VehicleLocationEntity
- Stores: vehicleId, latitude, longitude, speed, accuracy, bearing, timestamp
- Latest record only (update-on-insert)
- Can be queried independently

#### Trip's Vehicle Info
- Updates: current_latitude, current_longitude, current_speed, last_location_update
- Used by MQTT messages to always include latest location
- Embedded in TripResponse for consistency

### MQTT Message Structure

MQTT messages are NOT modified - the structure remains the same. Instead, null fields in the vehicle data are now populated with current values when available:

- `current_latitude` - populated from trip.vehicle.current_latitude
- `current_longitude` - populated from trip.vehicle.current_longitude
- `current_speed` - populated from trip.vehicle.current_speed

These fields are already part of the MQTT message structure in `convertTripResponseToTripData()` and are now automatically populated from the database updates.

## Build Status

✅ All files compile successfully  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Database migration from version 7 to 8 ready

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Navigation**: Verify location updates in NavigActivity logs
2. **Headless Navigation**: Verify location updates in HeadlessNavigActivity logs
3. **Database**: Check VehicleLocationEntity table for latest location per vehicle
4. **MQTT**: Verify MQTT messages include latest vehicle location
5. **Trip Data**: Verify Trip's vehicle info always has current lat/lng/speed

## Notes

- Bearing is stored in VehicleLocationEntity but NOT in Trip's vehicle info (per requirements)
- Location updates only trigger when waypoint progress is written (not on every GPS update)
- Both visual and headless modes capture and store location data identically
- MQTT always gets latest location because it reads from database before publishing
- MQTT message structure unchanged - only null fields are now populated with current data
